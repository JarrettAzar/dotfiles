# dotfiles

Welcome! These are my dotfiles, or configuration files for Linux applications. Most of these are here with the goal of *ricing* or what people do over on [the unixporn subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn).

Please take what you like, and suggest anything that you think would look better or be a good tool that I might not be using.

*WARNING: Copying entire configs is almost never a good idea, and usually leads to broken things*
